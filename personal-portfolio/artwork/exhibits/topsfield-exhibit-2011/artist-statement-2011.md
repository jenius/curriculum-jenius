##Gallery Artist Statement 2011

Chaz Southard is an award winning artist, poet and a long time Boston Area resident. He earned his undergraduate degree in Environmental Science from the University of New Hampshire, Web Design Certification from Boston University and currently a master degree candidate in Psychology at Lesley University in Cambridge Massachusetts. In addition, he is a nationally recognized advocate for the spinal cord injury community having written numerous articles and appearing on television across the country.

Chaz paints with the intention of creating a piece that brings the viewer into a space of curiosity and imagination. The fundamental elements in each piece are the ambiguity of space and time, rhythm, ordered chaos and the fluidity of a line. So much of both are seen in his web design work, paintings and digital artwork.
